# `tsnl` üêå

Welcome to my humble abode. üòä

I am a simulation software engineer at Tesla on the Optimus team who specializes in camera modeling, rendering, 
high-throughput synthetic data generation, and general software architecture. I'm also interested in physics engines, 
reinforcement learning, and solving challenging sim-to-real transfer problems.

My first loves are compilers, programming languages, and computer graphics. I typically work on these projects to 
unwind.

- [`tsnl.intstr`](https://github.com/tsnl/intstr): interned strings.
- [`tsnl.cc_embed`](https://github.com/tsnl/cc_embed): tools to embed binary files in C++ source code (with Bazel rules).
- [`tsnl.os_util`](https://github.com/tsnl/os_util): portable high-level operating system utilities, e.g. mmap-ed files.
- [`cpp_base`](https://github.com/tsnl/cpp_base): a common template for C++ repos.

**Rust tools**
- [`sexpfmt`](https://github.com/tsnl/sexpfmt): S-expression formatter, great for [expect tests](https://blog.janestreet.com/the-joy-of-expect-tests/).

**Compilers, interpreters, and programming languages**
- [`snail-scheme`](https://github.com/tsnl/snail-scheme): my Scheme interpreter and compiler (educational).
